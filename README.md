Dotfiles
========

This is my collection of dotfiles, preserved here for all to see and enjoy.
Feel free to copy anything you see here. It would be nice if you added a
comment mentioning where you got it.

My environment relies on `zsh`, `vim`, and `git`.

## Installation

Clone the repository to a directory on your machine. I like to use
`~/.dotfiles`.

    git clone https://github.com/erynofwales/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

Run the setup script.

    cd ~/.dotfiles
    ./setup.sh

This script will symlink all the files in the directory to your home directory
and initialize the various submodules (mostly Vim plugins).

Enjoy.
